UW NLP maintains a repository of corpora for internal UW use on the UW CSE
department fileserver at `/projects/nlp-corpora/`.

This document provides a live, browsable index of all of the corpora. Below
that are instructions for accessing the corpora and proposing new additions.

## Live Status

This table contains a live view of all corpora. It is updated daily by a
crawler that scans all corpora and checks that they meet quality guidelines
(immutability, access permissions, documentation, and corpus structure). Click
on any corpus to view its readme. More information on restricted access is
provided below.
