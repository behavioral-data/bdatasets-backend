UW NLP maintains a repository of corpora for internal UW use on the UW CSE
department fileserver at `/projects/nlp-corpora/`.

This document provides a live, browsable index of all of the corpora. Below
that are instructions for accessing the corpora and proposing new additions.

## Live Status

This table contains a live view of all corpora. It is updated daily by a
crawler that scans all corpora and checks that they meet quality guidelines
(immutability, access permissions, documentation, and corpus structure).

Click on any corpus to view its readme.

If the **Access** column shows a âœ“, then it is open-access and ready for use.
If not, the corpus is under restricted access due to its license or terms of
use. Visit the [Restricted access](#restricted-access) section for details on
each of these corpora.
